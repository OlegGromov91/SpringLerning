In this part of repository i try to lern Spring Boot conjunction with Angular, by video [**Amigoscode**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx4iBLKLVHk).
The app is a board with employee cards and with the functions to add, edit, search, and remove.

### **The following technologies i have used:** ###
___
- [ ] **Frontend**:
  - Angular CLI 13.0.3
  - NodeJS 12.20
+ (the following versions were chosen because i was using a virtual machine with Windows 7)
